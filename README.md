# Data-Cleaning-Project
This project focuses on cleaning a dataset of layoffs to ensure its accuracy, consistency, and usability. The main objective is to refine the data by removing duplicates, standardizing values, handling null or blank entries, and eliminating unnecessary information. The clean data will be more reliable for analysis and decision-making purposes.
