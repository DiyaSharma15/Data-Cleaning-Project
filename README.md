# Data-Cleaning-Project
This project focuses on cleaning a dataset of layoffs to ensure its accuracy, consistency, and usability. The main objective is to refine the data by removing duplicates, standardizing values, handling null or blank entries, and eliminating unnecessary information. The clean data will be more reliable for analysis and decision-making purposes.
## Steps

### 1. Remove Duplicates
- **Goal**: Identify and eliminate duplicate records to ensure each entry in the dataset is unique.
- **Approach**: Use specific criteria to find duplicates and then remove them while preserving the integrity of the data.

### 2. Standardize the Data
- **Goal**: Ensure consistency in the dataset by standardizing various fields.
- **Approach**: 
  - Trim extra spaces from text fields.
  - Harmonize similar values (e.g., industry names, country names) to a standard format.
  - Correct and convert data types (e.g., changing date fields to a uniform format).

### 3. Handle Null or Blank Values
- **Goal**: Address missing or incomplete data to improve the dataset's completeness.
- **Approach**:
  - Replace blank entries with null values for easier identification.
  - Fill in null values where possible by referencing other available data within the dataset.

### 4. Remove Unnecessary Data and Columns
- **Goal**: Simplify the dataset by removing irrelevant or redundant information.
- **Approach**: 
  - Identify columns and rows that do not contribute to the dataset's purpose.
  - Delete these unnecessary elements to streamline the data.

## Procedure

### Staging Table Creation
- **Purpose**: Create a staging area to perform data cleaning operations without altering the original dataset. This ensures data integrity and allows for error correction if needed.

### Duplicate Removal
- **Process**: Identify duplicates based on key columns and remove them to ensure each record is unique.

### Data Standardization
- **Process**: Standardize text fields by trimming spaces and unifying similar values. Convert data types to appropriate formats to ensure consistency.

### Handling Null Values
- **Process**: Convert blanks to nulls and fill in missing values by referencing other relevant data within the dataset.

### Removing Unnecessary Data
- **Process**: Identify and remove columns and rows that do not add value to the dataset, making it more concise and focused.

## Conclusion

This data cleaning project enhances the quality and usability of the layoffs dataset by ensuring it is accurate, consistent, and free of unnecessary clutter. The clean dataset will be more effective for analysis and provide more reliable insights.
